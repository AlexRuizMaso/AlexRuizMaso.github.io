Project analysis, User profile:
The type of person who would visit the website/curriculum would be someone who is engaged in hiring people
or who is looking for young talents who have finished their computer engineering degree or are finishing it.
And get on my website, because you want someone who have more knowledge and studies than someone who has only done
the degree.

Project analysis, Information architecture:
The structure of the webpage is organized into several sections to present relevant information in a clear,
sequential format. The main header contains the page title, "Àlex Ruiz CV," along with a navigation menu linking to
each major section of the page: Main, Education, Experience, Skills, and Contact.

The Main section introduces Àlex Ruiz, providing a brief biography highlighting my skills and studies in
informatics. The Education section follows, listing my academic achievements in a chronological format that
includes institution names, programs, and dates. Similarly, the Experience section details my work history with
titles, companies, and years of service for each role, visually distinct with styled lists.

In the Skills section, my technical competencies are displayed with logos representing each skill, categorized
into programming languages and tools such as Java, C++, Python, and Unity. This section is visually organized to
enhance readability through iconography and a flexible layout that adjusts to screen sizes. Also, there's an Others part that contains non informatic knowledge I have.

Lastly, the Contact section contains links to my email and GitHub profile, presented with icons to maintain visual
consistency. The page’s style.css file defines the color scheme and responsive layout, ensuring accessibility and a
professional appearance across devices.

Project analysis, Visual design:
The visual design of this webpage prioritizes simplicity, readability, and a professional aesthetic, aligning with
the purpose of a CV. Key design decisions include the use of a dark color scheme with a background in shades of
grey and white text, ensuring strong contrast for easy readability. The header and navigation bar feature a black
background with white text and yellow hover effects for interactivity, which helps guide users through the site
seamlessly.

Typography choices focus on clarity, with large, sans-serif fonts used for headings and slightly smaller, readable
fonts for body text. The headings are bold and set against a light grey background to create visual hierarchy,
allowing each section to stand out. In addition, the rounded borders and padding for each section and element
enhance visual separation and readability, making the information appear well-organized and accessible.

For the Skills section, icons are used to visually represent each programming language or tool, making it more
engaging and easier to scan quickly. These icons are set within rectangular containers that adjust responsively,
ensuring a neat layout across screen sizes.

Finally, in the Contact section, the email and GitHub icons reinforce the professional tone while using inverted
colors to match the site’s color scheme. This cohesive styling fosters a polished, user-friendly experience.

Language explanation:
I haven't used the english language to name my studies and the name of the institutions that I've been part. Thats becouse I personaly don't like to translate the cities, entities and similar names couse it seems non correctly if I know that the web user will understand it in the original language.
